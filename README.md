# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I approach software development less like puzzle-solving and more like digital archaeology, prioritizing architectural clarity and long-term maintainability over quick feature delivery. My process is defined by deliberate self-reflection; I treat debugging with counter-intuitive humility, immediately assuming my own logic is flawed to efficiently chase errors, and view compiler messages as cryptic, highly specific notes from a future-self. Beyond daily tasks, I maintain a niche interest in low-level efficiency, currently exploring the computational overhead of different hashing algorithms for simple file integrity checks. This commitment to detail extends to documentation, which I consider a necessary apology written for the colleague inheriting the repository at 3:00 AM, and informs my strong bias for the simplest, most obvious implementation that reduces dependencies instead of adding abstract complexity.
